    <h3>Round 1</h3>

    <!--we need to simplify the rules since I literally just copy and paste from assignment documetn lol-->

    <p>The player is required to answer a series of questions within two minutes, with the aim of banking at most $500,000 from the “MONEY TREE”. The money tree is layered as follows: </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>$500,000</li>
        <li>$250,000</li>
        <li>$125,000</li>
        <li>$75,000</li>
        <li>$50,000</li>
        <li>$10,000</li>
        <li>$5,000</li>
        <li>$1,000</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>If the player answers a question correctly, the money will move upwards the “Money Tree”, by one level. If the player answers the question wrong, the money is lost and the “Money Tree” starts from $0 again.</p>
      
      <p>Before a question is asked, the player is allowed to bank the money that corresponds to the level they are at on the “Money Tree”.However, the player should not be allowed to bank money if they are on level $0 on the money tree.</p>
      
      <p>If the player banks the money it stays safe, however the “Money Tree”, will start again, from $0. </p>

      <p>Note, for this round you can ONLY bank at most $500,000.</p>
      
      <p>Once the timer runs out, the player will automatically go onto round 2 along with all money banked. Also, if the user banks $500,000 before the timer runs out they will automatically go onto round 2.</p>
